FIF : Functional Isolation Forest
=========================================

This repository hosts Python code of the Functional Isolation Forest algorithms and its extension to Multivariate functional data. Here we provide the source code for the algorithms as well as example notebooks to help get started.

Installation
------------

To get the latest version of the code::

  $ git clone https://github.com/Gstaerman/FIF.git
  
Algorithm
---------
Functional Isolation Forest is an anomaly detection (and anomaly ranking) algorithm for functional data.
It shows a great flexibility to distinguish most of anomaly types of functional data.

Quick Start :
------------

.. code:: python
   
   import numpy as np
   m =100
   n =100
   tps = np.linspace(0,1,m)
   v = np.linspace(1,1.4,n)
   X = np.zeros((n,m))
   Y = np.zeros((10,m))
   for i in range(n):
   X[i] = 30 * ((1-tps) ** v[i]) * tps ** v[i]
   for i in range(10):
       for j in range(m):
           if (tps[j]<0.2 or tps[j]>0.8):
               Y[i,j] = 30 * ((1-tps[j]) ** 1.2) * tps[j] ** 1.2 
           else:
               Y[i,j] = 30 * ((1-tps[j]) ** 1.2) * tps[j] ** 1.2 + np.random.normal(0,0.3,1)
   Y[:,0] = 0
   Y[:,m-1] = 0
   Z = np.concatenate((X,Y), axis = 0)
   
And then use FIF to ranking functional dataset :

.. code:: python

   F1  = FIForest(Z, D="Brownian", time=tps, innerproduct="auto", alpha=1)
   S1  = F1.compute_paths()
   F2  = FIForest(Z, D="Brownian", time=tps, innerproduct="auto", alpha=0)
   S2  = F2.compute_paths()
    
S1 and S2 are the score of all functions in the dataset. S1 come from FIF with $L_2$ scalar product while
S2 come from FIF with $L_2$ derivate scalar product. Anomaly score increases from magenta to yellow in the left plot and decreases in the right plot.
